# MonthlyAndYearly-CustomerSales-Analysis
# Project Overview
This project involves the analysis and visualization of customer sales data across the United States. The goal is to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior by analyzing various factors, including revenue distribution by state, age, gender, product categories, and the impact of discount percentages on the quantity ordered. Using Tableau for visualization, this project provides insights into how these variables influence sales performance across different regions and customer demographics.

The analysis was conducted as part of a second-semester Data Mining and Visualization course. While the project delivers valuable insights from the dashboard, further in-depth analysis is required to develop custom code and explore additional factors influencing customer purchasing decisions.

# Case Description
The dataset used for this analysis includes various attributes related to customer purchases, such as geographical location, month of the year, age group, gender, and product categories. The case aims to understand customer behavior in relation to these variables and identify trends or patterns in sales. The dashboard provides a summary of these insights in a visual format, focusing on revenue distribution, discount effects, and purchasing behavior across different customer demographics.

# Objectives
- To visualize and analyze revenue distribution across various states and regions in the United States.
- To identify trends in customer purchasing behavior based on age, gender, and product categories.
- To examine the impact of discounts on the quantity of items ordered.
- To explore monthly trends in revenue generation throughout the year.
- To provide actionable insights based on the visualizations for better decision-making regarding marketing strategies and sales optimization.

# Project Steps and Features
The Tableau dashboard contains six key visualizations that provide detailed insights:
1. Revenue per State:
- A choropleth map showing the total revenue generated by each state. Darker shades represent higher revenue, with Texas having the highest revenue of 15,467,456.
- This feature helps visualize which states contribute most significantly to total sales.

2. Revenue Based on Month of the Year:
- A bar chart illustrating revenue generated each month. November 2020 is the top-performing month with 57,966,909 in sales, while October 2020 had the lowest revenue at 4,203,196.
- This visualization highlights seasonal trends in sales.

3. Revenue Based on Age:
- A bar chart that breaks down sales revenue by age group. The 31-40 age group generated the highest revenue of 44,782,546, while the <20 age group contributed the least with 6,967,488.
- This analysis provides insights into which age groups drive the most sales.

4. Percentage of Revenue per Region:
- A pie chart that shows the proportion of total revenue coming from four major regions: South, Midwest, Northeast, and West. The South region contributes 38.37% of the total revenue.
- This helps identify regional sales distribution and market dominance.

5. Quantity - Discount Percentage Correlation:
- A scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between discount percentages and the quantity of items ordered. Most orders occur at low to moderate discounts (0-30%), but significant quantities are ordered at higher discounts (above 60%).
- This feature highlights the influence of discount levels on order volumes.

6. Revenue per Category per Gender:
- A bar chart that compares revenue across various product categories, segmented by gender. 'Mobiles & Tablets' is the top-performing category for both genders, with over 60 million in revenue.
- This feature identifies gender-specific product preferences and purchasing behavior.

# Tools Used
The primary tool used for this project is Tableau. Tableau was utilized to create the visualizations and generate insights from the customer sales data. While no programming or data manipulation was performed using code, Tableau provided an intuitive platform for visual data analysis.

# Challenges
- Limited Data Processing: The analysis was entirely conducted using Tableauâ€™s dashboard functionality, which limits data preprocessing capabilities. Future work may require additional coding in Python or SQL for better data cleaning and transformation.
- No Custom Code Implementation: Since this project did not involve custom code, further work is needed to replicate or enhance the visualizations programmatically, using programming languages such as Python or R.
- Scalability: The dashboard provides valuable insights based on the data available, but more advanced analytics, such as predictive modeling, require deeper exploration and additional coding efforts.

# Conclusion
This Tableau dashboard offers a high-level analysis of customer sales data based on various demographic and transactional factors. It provides clear insights into the geographical distribution of revenue, purchasing behavior by age and gender, and the impact of discounts on sales volumes. However, this project is limited to dashboard analysis only, with no coding or in-depth data processing performed. To build a more comprehensive solution, future steps include developing custom code to handle data preprocessing, further analysis, and predictive insights.

The dashboard serves as a good starting point for understanding the data and developing business strategies, but it requires further development to fully explore the potential of the dataset.
